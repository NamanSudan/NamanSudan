As a software engineer with a focus on data and AI systems, my experiences at three startups  Kube8r, Accelera Payments, and Famished span several key areas:

- Designing and implementing scalable data pipelines and ETL processes
- Architecting and optimizing AI/ML systems, particularly in search and recommendation domains
- Developing robust backend services and APIs for high-traffic applications
- Implementing MLOps practices to streamline model deployment and monitoring

I'm particularly passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex data challenges. Whether it's optimizing query performance, implementing advanced embedding techniques, or designing microservices architectures, I like to approach each task with an eye for detail, ability to scale, and a commitment to excellent development outcomes.

My ideal roles involve pushing the boundaries of data engineering, AI implementation, or backend development. I'm well-suited for positions that require a blend of technical depth and strategic thinking, such as:

- Senior Data Engineer
- AI/ML Systems Architect
- Backend Engineer (with a focus on data-intensive applications)
- MLOps Specialist
I'm get very excited about opportunities that allow me to continue growing in these areas while contributing to impactful projects. My goal is to be part of a team that values innovation, continuous learning, and the practical application of advanced technologies.
